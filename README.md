## The last stretch

  The library computer screen buzzed for the third time as a buffering circle began spinning once more above a bland white document screen. 
  
  "Oh- My- God, Judy!" screamed a shrill voice from inside Judy's small Nokia, "you literally have 30 minutes before lecture starts! What is taking so long?"
  
  Judy rolled her eyes. As if what was taking her so long wasn't clearly the fault of her lab partner, Mikayla, not printing the Biology lab assignment the night prior when she had finished editing the document. It was like Mikayla had never used Google Docs before, expecting the cloud storage to just load up in a second and be ready to print like that. No, instead, Judy was left staring at a grey circle and an unloaded Doc with burning anxiety beginning to creep in her stomach.
  
  "You know what-" Judy began, but then let out a sigh as she realized she was getting stares from around the library, "it's almost done loading, I'll just print it out and then run over." And with a spring of luck, the Doc finally rendered, showing off their polished lab report. Judy felt her shoulder drop in relaxation with the sight of the document now loading on the dusty computer screen.
  
  The report was very simple; they really hadn't put too much work into it, or rather Mikayla didn't. Judy hovered over the many tabs searching for the print button; if only they had been easier ways to print quickly, then maybe she would shave off a couple of minutes off her race to the deadline.
  
  Judy set her phone down from her shoulder and went to click print when she noticed a red line on the end of the document. She scrolled down to the bottom of the page, where she noticed a new edit that had overlapped her work from the night before. The words cascaded over one another, indicating two people had tried to edit the same sentence in the same hour. Google Docs didn't seem to like that. 
  
  As much as Judy appreciated the extra help from her lab partner, she often forgot that Mikayla was less technologically savvy than herself. Having worked with Google Docs before, Judy knew one of the software's biggest setbacks: simultaneous editing. The program syncs with the cloud servers every hour, so any changes within that time from different editors cause major problems. Still, clearly, Mikayla didn't listen when Judy had warned her about this feature the night before.
  
  "Mikayla, did you change the conclusion?" Judy gasped, frantically trying to type to fix the errors, knowing well enough that the computer was going to fight her back. The cursor shifted, paused, then returned to its original space. Internet glitches always did seem to come at the most inconvenient of times. 
  
  The silence of the other end of the phone, Judy took as a yes. Rolling her eyes, she waited until the changes in the document rendered before trying again at printing. A little notification popped up signalling the report, now fully finished, had been sent over to the printers. Judy went to stand up and grab the paper when she heard her name being called from below her.
  
  "Judy!" called the phone from the desk. Judy hastily picked it up and plopped it back on her shoulder.
  
  "Yes?" she replied, "it's just printing now."
  
  "Oh, nice! But can you get the rubric in the Drive folder? I just realized I forgot mine."
  
  Judy nearly dropped her phone. Her eyes jolted over to the clock, now reading 15 minutes till her class. Mikayla was lucky the library was beside the lecture hall for their Biology class, or this assignment was all for naught. 
  
  Judy threw on her best cheery voice and let Mikayla know the rubric was loading. Yet another document to open that was not prepared for. Her fingers drummed against the desk as she navigated to her profs shared Drive. And began the loading process again, this time using the waiting period to go grab the printed report from the other side of the room; she knew it would be a while until it was ready to be printed as well. If only Mikayla had started with the missing rubric, she could have at least begun loading the page along with the report. But beggars can't be choosers, and Judy definitely didn't choose Mikayla as her lab partner.
  
  Once the rubric was loaded, she sent it to the printer with now 2 minutes to spare. If anything could be salvaged from this horrible experience was that she would at least get a good workout from it. Snatching the paper from the printer on her way out, Judy threw her bag over her shoulder and sprinted for the door.
  
  Serves her right for leaving things to the last minute. Serves her right for trusting Mikayla.


## Micro Essay

  My speculative fiction story about a 1995 Google Docs user reaches into media archeology by considering the changes in user habits and the remaining oldness in new media. Judy’s experience using Google Docs demonstrates the oldness in a word sharing software, pulling from not only Word documents or typing out a file, but also the idea of sharing a file with someone and dealing with partners slacking off. However, Judy’s rush to finish this assignment also shows the user habits that must change to adapt to a new technology of any kind. Being in 1995 with slower internet and less technology to handle high traffic cloud synchronization, the user must adapt to the limitations and suffer the consequences if they fail to accommodate those limits. In Parikka’s excerpt, they describe this very concept saying, “new media might be here and slowly changing our user habits, but old media never left us.” This quote outlines how new media require user habits to change and the culture surrounding it while still recognizing that old media never entirely leaves the new. Even in 1995, Google Docs still pulls from things like a Word file or a typewriter. Old media has a powerful influence on the format and uses of the new media; however, it is how one uses this technology that sets it apart. The story demonstrates how users adapt to or attempt to adapt to the medium by changing user habits and being aware of user-controlled errors like overwriting a sentence due to two people editing at once. We see the way this sense of ease of use plays out in 1995, where the tech cannot keep up to the level of immediacy the characters needed, but for someone with low internet and used to the quips of the program, they learn to expect the wait times and find a way to attempt and change their behaviours based on them. My speculative fiction story makes readers consider the oldness in our new media; somethings have never changed, and it is only us that have done the changing.
